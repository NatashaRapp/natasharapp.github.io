						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>When I entered the Master of Development Practice Program (MDP) program at the University of Arizona, I had few expectations. I looked forward to working on meaningful projects, learning new concepts and skills, and meeting new people across multiple cultures and backgrounds. Despite the turbulence and varied support within the MDP program, these hopes have been fulfilled. During my time as a MDP student I have had the privilege of working with diverse researchers on intersectional projects, learned a wealth of new skills, and have made connections with bright scholars from across the world. </p>
							<p>The following pages are mere traces of the research and projects I have contributed to since my enrollment in MDP. These are pieces of a varied process, checkered with shortfalls and triumphs. Although I am proud of the work I have done and knowledge gained throughout the MDP program, what is captured in this portfolio cannot convey all of my research contributions, experience, trials and tribulations. Unillustrated in this portfolio is juggling 2-3 jobs while supporting a full-time academic schedule. Not only this, but the following pages only conveys a glimmer of the friendships and comradery that had been formed 
							by fellow MDP peers and other members of the University of Arizona community.</p>
							<p>The contents you are about to review are not just pieces of an assignment. Rather, the following portfolio is a visual and verbal mosaic of my journey since 2021. Although my enrollment in MDP started in 2021, my curiosity and frustration of the social and environmental systems that influence our globalized world had been percolating for many years leading up to my enrollment in MDP. The following pieces are mere tiles that made up the mosaic of my MDP journey experience. Thank you in advance for your viewership.

						<h2>Program Focus and Goals</h2>
						<p>Witnessing inequities across race, class, and geography, inspired Natasha to pursue a 
							Master’s of Development Practice degree at the University of Arizona. Through this 
							program Natasha studied key aspects of sustainable and resilient international 
							development. Natasha’s focus throughout the program was monitoring and evaluation 
							techniques for scaling climate change adaptation and mitigation in a socially just 
							manner. By engaging with research and topics such as economic anthropology, gender 
							equity, public health and environmental policy, Natasha has developed a qualitative 
							analysis perspective to better inform the technical skills developed during and prior to MDP. 
							Cultivating knowledge of and implementing holistic methods realized the goals of practicing 
							and implementing holistic frameworks address climate change’s impact on natural and human-built
							environments and systems. </p>
						</p>By focusing on experiential learning, Natasha was able to 
							achieve her goals to contribute to policy research, scientific communications, and geospatial
							 and data visualization. Pursuing and accomplishing coursework, internships, and various

									<p>Most of the contents included in the portfolio are a direct result of Natasha's experiential 
										learning journey through her internships, practicum, and professional projects. The items 
										displayed throughout this portfolio demonstrate Natasha’s skillsets in scientific verbal 
										and visual communications. A significant portion of the research and product development 
										was owned by multiple university departments, programs, and independent research entities, 
										the following items were thoughtfully reconstructed to present within Natasha's professional 
										portfolio. The following portfolio items were independently crafted to showcase the breadth of activities while safeguarding the 
										rightful ownership of the research, practicum, and graduate research assistantship experiences. </p>

						<p>While working in the Tellman Social [Pixel] Lab, I was convinced satellite technology had many merits and beneficial<br /> 
							applications to science and society. It was also during this period in my academic journey when billionaires started<br /> 
							to launch space and near-earth technology and exploration enterprises. At this development, I began wondering about <br />
							the impact of satellite technology. After investigating American and international policy, I crafted this piece <br />
							about Space Debris and discovered unexpected impact upon the Global South.<br /></p>

								<h3>Scientific Visual Communications</h3>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow"></div>
								<p style="font-weight: bold;">Climate Change: Impacts to Arizona Public Health</p>
										<p>Much of the content I generated for my role with RHPP was for the benefit
											of program enrollees and the program instructors. In this position 
											I created lecture materials, gathered course education materials and 
											assignments pertaining to topics that intersected with Climate Change, 
											Public Health, and policy. . For my portfolio, I decided to adapt some of the 
											information I had been exposed to and create an infographic that could be used 
											as an awareness campaign. The video infographic delivers cited information that 
											interconnects Climate Change, environmental health, and the well-being of 
											Arizonans. The infographic serves accurate and impactful facts in an engaging 
											format of saturated imagery and music. In this internet age of fast information, 
											the video content is condensed down to less than one and a half minutes, making 
											it a good fit for a social media information campaign:</p>
											<br>
											<video src ="video/Climate_Change_and_Public_Health_in_Arizona.mp4" 
											poster = "CC_video.jpg"></video>
											<a href=https://express.adobe.com/video/Me46ClEUakGv6><i>Climate Change in Arizona: Local Impacts & Challenges</i></a></p>

							 <p style="font-weight: bold;">Climate Change in Arizona: Local Impacts & Challenges Interactive Infographic:</p>
								<p>This infographic was created when I could not find a visually appealing map
									of rural Arizona while creating learning materials for the UArizona’s RHPP program.
									As many of the materials were cultivated for the specific benefit of the program’s 
									enrollees, I was inspired to create an interactive infographic that would convey 
									geographic, public health, and environmental justice information. The vector map 
									was designed for the viewer to interact with the Arizona landscape while learning 
									about current health and justice issues that are exasperated by Climate Change. 
									The purpose of this static infographic is to contain a large amount of information
									within a succinct design. The pop-up facts were gathered through my own independent
									research of scholarly and journalistic-news publications. The initial vector map 
									graphic was crafted through Adobe Illustrator. Then I designed the interactive 
									web elements through the tools available in Adobe InDesign:</p>
